# Probability and Statistics

**(2022 summer, CUHK)**

Welcome to the 2022 summer short course for MSc.

## Contents

The teaching materials will be edited when the dates approach.

Three topics will be covered:
* [Probability](https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Econ_prob/blob/master/01_prob.ipynb)
* [Statistic](https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Econ_prob/blob/master/02_stat.ipynb)
* [Basic asymptotics](https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Econ_prob/blob/master/03_asym.ipynb)

The contents can be found in the Jupyter notebook lecture notes, which can be displayed in a web browser in a static form.

## Interactive code

The following approaches make it possible to interact with the code cells in the Jupyter notebooks.

1. Download to your local computer the Github repository. Copy and paste `git clone https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Econ_prob.git` in a terminal if the Git system is installed.
2. Log in CUHK Econ's [SCRP server](https://scrp-login-2.econ.cuhk.edu.hk/jupyter). Git and R kernels are already installed there. Download the Github repos by copy and paste `git clone https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Econ_prob.git`
3. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Download the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ztshi/msc_prob_and_stat) for this course by running `docker pull ztshi/msc_prob_and_stat` in a terminal. The Github repository is already written in the folder. Run `docker run -p 10000:8888 ztshi/msc_prob_and_stat` in a terminal. A token must be copied to log in the web browser interface.
4. Click the online [binder server](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zhentaoshi/Econ_prob/HEAD). It may take some time to build the environment. Be patient. Changes cannot be saved by this approach, and thus they will get lost after closing your web browser. This is the most convenient option. However, in my experiments it is unstable due to the memory capacity that `mybinder` offers. You can try if if you wish.


Note: If you modify the code or text, the above approaches 1 and 2 allow you to save your changes. 


## Extensive reading
Besides the lecture notes in this Github repository, you will find self-contained lecture notes in the first two chapters of
Kevin Sheppard's [Financial Economics I](https://www.kevinsheppard.com/teaching/mfe/notes/) for MSc at Oxford University.
